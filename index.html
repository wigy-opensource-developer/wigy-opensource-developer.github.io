<p>Why would you ever read this? You came here googling your own problem and found a solution in one of my posts. If you are reading this, you are interested in either my background or want to see a photo about me. Sorry to disappoint you, but I am kinda' secretive about those. Let's just stereotype me as an older-than-average family man who started programming his ZX-Spectrum in Basic then assembly.</p>
