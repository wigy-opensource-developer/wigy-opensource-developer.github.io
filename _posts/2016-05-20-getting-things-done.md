title: Getting things done
---
There is a difference between those people who can [get things
done](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000339.html) and those who
can get things done *alone without any help*. I had to realize the hard way that
I am not in the 2nd category. I am struggling with myself if I am left alone on
a task. My brain goes into depth-first-search mode on the problems and you know
what happens to that algorithm in an infinitely deep graph...

So. I need help focusing on the priorities of the project. Say a
pair-programming partner or someone who I can mumble to every now and then
because they are doing something that can be interrupted without punishment.
*Then* I can code along happily and produce golden code that people read just
because they enjoy reading it. ;P

Also, it makes me really depressed when I do not get things done. If I am just
spending my time at work reading articles, watching screencasts and fighting
with my system configuration, I go home sad. I depend on team-mates to get
my portion of success.
